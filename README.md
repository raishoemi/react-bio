# Abstract
As of now, this project's goal is to assist in visualizing and searching known occurrances biology's central dogma: the relationship between genome and proteins.  
Proteins are the machines that power complex life. Understanding how they're synthesized, and how we can utilize them is essential to the progression of medicine in particular, and control over chemical reactions in general.  
Being able to synthesize custom made proteins, just like we write code, is next step in human evolution.

I apologize for being over-dramatic, this is probably all a simulation anyway

## Goals
For now I'm just joshing around with what I can do with existing data, once this takes shape I'll write down more concrete goals.
